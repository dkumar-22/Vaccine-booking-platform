# Vaxtrail Web App

## Introduction

Vaxtrail is an online vaccine booking or distribution system, helping users to tackle the current pandemic. Itâ€™s a completely online system which would promote digitization and even promote social distancing as slots for vaccination would be available at the nearest hospital <b>(within 2 kilometres of radius)</b> everyday thus reducing/ minimizing the risk of overcrowding.  

Our project will help to keep things in order, maintaining proper records. 

Users will be notified about their appointment using mail and SMS.
Also, developed a feature that gives priority to the senior citizens in the process, also they will be able to choose time slots as per their ease.

Users can (after 5 days of their vaccination give appropriate feedback) which can provide information about the effectiveness of vaccines.

## Technologies Utilised

It is MERN based project using MongoDB for database management, a popular NoSQL database management software, we will be using ReactJS for designing the front end and Express and Node JS for designing the backend, thus making it as a full stack project.

## Database Description

Utilised MongoDB for storing the data. Used 5 MongoDB collections to store and use the data accordingly.
